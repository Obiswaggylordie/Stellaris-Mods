origin_commorragh_eldar:0 "Dark Eldar"
origin_commorragh_eldar_desc:0 "Dark Eldar are kindred to the Asuryani and other Aeldari, an ancient and advanced race of elf-like humanoids. Their armies usually have the advantages of speed and technology, though they are often lacking in resilience and numbers. The Dark Eldar revel in piracy, enslavement and torture, and are sadistic in the extreme. Due to their use of the galaxy-spanning inter-dimensional labyrinth known as the Webway, they are extremely mobile, striking from seemingly nowhere, with little or no warning, and vanishing with their captives before significant military reaction can be mobilised. The Dark Eldar are unique amongst the races in the sense that they do not occupy many planets, but rather one dark city called Commorragh."

origin_craftworld_aeldari_desc:0 "The Aeldari (the term for themselves before their race fell or Eldar are an ancient race of elf-like humanoids.

After the Fall of the Eldar they lost their main homeworlds and are currently scattered among the stars and webway in different factions and allegiences. The Ynnari are the members of a newly formed eponymous Eldar group that worship the God Ynnead and believe their race can be saved from the depredation of Slaanesh, Chaos God of Pleasure, by helping to bring about the birth of the slumbering god of the dead."

No humans have ever walked on the streets of the capital, located on the equator, and Imperial scans are blocked by some Tau technology. At the centre of this city appears to be a heavily defended fortress, possibly the heart of the Tau empire, the high council of the Ethereals."

It is also unique, in that it has claimed the worlds of the Tiamet System without entirely stripping them of biomass and continues to guard its conquered territory with single-minded ferocity. When was encountered by an iperial pioneer flee the system contained seven life-sustaining worlds and a host of lesser planetoids. They surprisingly noted that every biosphere was infact a Death World swarming with dangerous life forms which managed to flourish despite whether the prevailing conditions were jungle, ice, desert or even airless rock. It was also discovered a continent-spanning organic conical structure, formed of chitin and soft encephalic flesh, that thrummed with immense psychic energy. Since then Tiamet system was fusion bombed on several occasions, but life was never fully extinguished."

Even warbands that haven't given completely over to their love of speed will often have many bikes or vehicles in their force. This clan also contains more Mekboyz than most, and therefore they often field more mechanical creations than other clanz."

The Senatorum is an Imperial governing body led by twelve leaders of the most powerful organisations of the Imperium. This body rules the Imperium in the Emperor's name. The Senatorum itself is composed of tens of thousands of Imperial dignitaries, nobleman, lords, and other officials, but these rarely meet and instead the 'High Twelve' conduct the vast majority of affairs."
 civic_imperialcult_fanatics:0 "Imperial Cult Fanatics"
 civic_imperialcult_fanatics_desc:0 "The Imperial Cult, also called the Cult Imperialis in High Gothic, is the official and only state religion of the Imperium of Man. It is devoted to the worship of the Emperor of Mankind as the ascended divinity and saviour of humanity. Those who believe in the Cult's teachings hold that the Emperor is a living spiritual entity and the only true god of Mankind. The Imperial Cult is led by the Adeptus Ministorum, also known as the Ecclesiarchy, who devote their lives to spreading the Word of the Emperor and doing His will."
 civic_machine_cult:0 "Machine Cult"
 civic_machine_cult_desc:0 "The religion of the Machine God - is a complex and labyrinthine structure, a creed of secret rites and ceremonial processions that is never shared with outsiders. Within each Forge World the myriad ranks of Tech-priests vie for mastery in a world where only through the accumulation of technology and hoarded knowledge can one advance."
 civic_imperium_secundus:0 "Imperium Secundus"
 civic_imperium_secundus_desc:0 "The Imperium Secundus, known also as the Unremembered Empire, was the second stellar empire of Humanity created by the Ultramarines Primarch Roboute Guilliman in 009.M31 during the Horus Heresy following the horrific events of the Battle of Calth and the Drop Site Massacre of Istvaan V. The Imperium Secundus was eventually folded back into the larger Imperium before the end of the Horus Heresy in 014.M31. It was later considered by Guilliman one of his greatest mistakes and an event that he was not eager for others to learn of once he was resurrected to serve as Lord Commander of the Imperium after the birth of the Great Rift in the late 41st Millennium."
 civic_horde_traditions:0 "Horde Traditions"
 civic_horde_traditions_desc:0 "Consummate horsemen and archers, these disparate tribes frequently fought one another for control of ancestral pastureland or - as their own ballads would have it - the sheer joy of battle. Chogorian armies had never invaded the Empty Quarter as the dry and desolate lands were of no value to the Palatine's people. However, the feudal nobles of the Palatine's state would often lead hunting bands into the steppes and take whole tribes east as slaves or capture a lone tribesmen to hunt through the mountains for sport."
 civic_barbarian_culture:0 "Barbarian Culture"
 civic_barbarian_culture_desc:0 "But the great lump of solid granite the Fenrisian tribesmen know as the polar continent of Asaheim always stands fast, a single, changeless continent on a world of fire, ice, ruin and torment. This extreme geography has resulted in the human population of Fenris becoming one composed largely of primitive, nomadic, barbarian tribes who barely approximate an Iron Age level of development. The tribes constantly seek secure territory, and as a result skirmishes and feuds over land between rival tribes are common. The Fenrisian people are hardened to the changes in temperature and environmental extremes, and so is the native fauna."
 civic_blacksmith_culture:0 "Blacksmith Culture"
 civic_blacksmith_culture_desc:0 "The vast eastern ocean of Nocturne, it is highly volatile, harbouring many black smokers and underground faults that erupt sporadically in spumes of super-heated water and steam from the ocean bed. Though it seems to be a strange place to live, the people along its coast have been moulded into stronger and more resilient forms. The Time of Trial also brings great rewards. Rich veins of gems and metals are revealed, enough to be mined by the people to pay for livestock and food on the interplanetary market. Tradition is revered strongly of Nocturne, especially the tradition of smithing, as is evident by the presence of numerous 'Great Forges,' all across Nocturne."
 civic_production_guilds:0 "Production Guilds"
 civic_production_guilds_desc:0 "The planet Kiavahr is populated by billions of workers and craftsmen, with huge fabrication plants and hive cities covering its surface. The planet's atmosphere is highly toxic from centuries of pollution and incidences of mutation are far higher than normal.

The Ultramarines were originally the XIII Space Marine Legion before the reforms that initiated the Second Founding and reshaped the Imperium after the Heresy on the orders of Guilliman himself.

The Blood Angels are amongst the longest-living of the Adeptus Astartes, with some of the Chapter's Space Marines having served the Emperor of Mankind for over a thousand standard years. Due to recent events, the Blood Angels' numbers were severely depleted.

Instead, the Imperial Fists rely on their 10,000-year-old mobile space fortress, Phalanx, to serve as their fortress-monastery. They maintain recruitment-chapels on various worlds spread throughout the Imperium. Part of the Imperial Fists' duties during the Great Crusade were to function as the Emperor's 'personal praetorians', accompanying Him everywhere.

The Salamanders as a Chapter are unusually concerned with civilian casualties compared to most other Space Marines and believe that one of their most important duties is to protect the lives of the Emperor of Mankind's innocent subjects whenever and wherever possible.

From its earliest days, the warriors of the XIXth Legion were known as cunning and patient hunters, adept at biding their time until the moment to strike was at hand. When the Legion was united with its Primarch - Corvus Corax, the Raven Lord, the Deliverer, theirs was a form of warfare exemplifying speed, stealth and precision which was codified into their doctrine, and under the ivory-skinned, shadow-eyed and sable-haired Primarch, the XIXth Legion carved its name in the annals of the Great Crusade."

After the Horus Heresy and the resultant Second Founding reforms of the Adeptus Astartes, the Space Wolves Legion was divided into two Chapters: the new Space Wolves Chapter, which was not compliant with the dictates of the Codex Astartes and retained the name of its parent Legion, and the second Chapter which took the name of the Wolf Brothers.

Organised cults dedicated to Khorne can only successfully operate where there are no real laws. The head of the cult is invariably an extremely powerful, merciless individual who goads his minions into battle with promises of blood and gore. The cults must behave like sharks — they must be constantly on the move, killing whenever possible.

The Colleges of Magic are constantly on the hunt for Cults of Tzeentch, viewing them as horrid aberrations that meddle in things that should be left alone. The Colleges engage in constant pogroms within their membership, rooting out those who have fallen sway to Tzeentch’s control.

In their madness, they come to believe that Nurgle offers some form of salvation or understanding of pestilence and the entropy of the world. Few realise their misguided convictions only fuel Nurgle’s power, creating a never-ending cycle of disease and despair. Cults of Nurgle recruit members from those suffering from horrible afflictions, nihilists, and those driven insane from disease or despair. Nurgle drives them to wander the Old World, spreading pestilence wherever they go. While most cultists eventually succumb to the numerous diseases they carry, a few become strangely energised by their afflictions, mutating into disgusting forms.

The cult of Slaanesh strives to insinuate itself in all levels of society. It is popular among the upper classes, the members of which often do not know exactly what it is that they are worshipping. In their quest for pleasurable moments, these misguided folk find amusement and novelty in paying homage to strange, seductive idols or partaking in debauched gatherings behind closed doors. Artists, poets, and other seekers of sensual things are often drawn to Slaanesh’s cults.

It was this rivalry between the Legions, and between their Primarchs Perturabo and the Imperial Fists' Rogal Dorn, that helped turn the Iron Warriors to Chaos. Like the members of the Adeptus Mechanicus and the Loyalist Iron Hands Chapter, the Iron Warriors have a strong predilection for replacing parts of their body with cybernetic enhancements.

Every current member of the Legion possesses psychic abilities and they prefer to use Chaos Sorcerers and guile in combat, relying on their psychic powers and sorcerous knowledge to earn them victory. As a result of an ancient spell known as the Rubric of Ahriman that was cast soon after the Thousand Sons fell from their homeworld of Prospero during the early days of the Horus Heresy, every Thousand Sons Astartes that lacked psychic powers had his soul fused directly into his Power Armour.

When the XIVth Legion was first raised on Terra by the Emperor during the First Founding, its Astartes were known as the Dusk Raiders. After the XIVth Legion was reunited with its Primarch Mortarion on the world of Barbarus, he renamed the Legion the Death Guard. The Death Guard are a Traitor Legion entirely steeped in the power of Nurgle, the god of death and plagues, their very essence the epitome of all that vile Chaos God stands for.

The Black Legion, at that time still known as the Sons of Horus, became the primary instrument of its Primarch, the Warmaster Horus, to overthrow the Emperor of Mankind and seize control of the Imperium in the name of Chaos. Such are the crimes of the Black Legion that it is easy to forget that the past was very different, and that there was a time when its Astartes and their perfidious master Horus were lauded above all of the other warriors of the Legiones Astartes, and were considered the most favoured servants of the Emperor of Mankind."

They are experts in infiltration, covert operations, misdirection and diversion tactics, and their armies contain many Chaos Cultists and other mortal agents in addition to regular Heretic Astartes. The Alpha Legion's Primarch was named Alpharius, and was actually one of the identical twin Primarchs Alpharius Omegon, two brilliant and secretive sons of the Emperor, one of whom was reportedly later killed after the end of the Horus Heresy by Roboute Guilliman, the Primarch of the Ultramarines.

The Night Lords are experts in the use of terror tactics to win battles and demoralise their foes before the main combat even begins. The Night Lords are synonymous with terror and murder, for their favoured mode of warfare is the unfettered application of brutal, overwhelming force.

The Red Corsairs were once a Loyalist Space Marine Chapter called the Astral Claws who were based on the world of Badab Primaris in the Badab Sector of the Ultima Segmentum. The Astral Claws were, ironically, raised during the 10th Founding in the 35th Millennium to guard against the numerous daemonic and alien threats emerging from the Maelstrom. Under the leadership of their Chapter Master, Lufgt Huron, the 'Tyrant of Badab', in the late 41st Millennium, the Astral Claws sought to have the Badab Sector secede from the Imperium of Man.

Due to the large number of vehicles in each warband, they often have several of the Oddboyz known as Meks amongst their number to keep their vehicles running. Sometimes a warband of Speed Freeks is even led by a Big Mek instead of a Warboss."
 civic_teeth_growers:0 "Teeth Growers"
 civic_teeth_growers_desc:0 "The Bad Moons are the richest Orks around, because their teef grow faster than anyone else's. This is not regarded as an unfair advantage, as any Ork big and nasty enough can simply smash the teef out of a Bad Moon's head. The Bad Moons essentially fulfill the role of a merchant caste in what passes for Ork society, and have a reputation for showing off."
 civic_scavengers_mobz:0 "Scavengers Mobz"
 civic_scavengers_mobz_desc:0 "The Deathskulls, or Death Skulls, are an Ork 'klan' that has an unsavoury reputation as inveterate looters, scavengers, borrowers, and scroungers. The Orks of the Deathskull klan have a well-deserved reputation as thieves and filchers. Never ones to pay their fair share or spend teef when an item can be spirited away with a modicum of effort, the Deathskulls are nearly as mistrusted among fellow Orks as their cousins the Blood Axes."
 civic_camouflage_boyz:0 "Camouflage Boyz"
 civic_camouflage_boyz_desc:0 "The Blood Axes were the first Orks to encounter the Imperium of Man. They have picked up many human tactics, such as using camouflage (although it may seem a bit too brightly colored to a human's eye) and retreating when they are losing ('It don't count as losing, cuz we can also come back for anuvver go, see?'). Indeed, when they do retreat, Blood Axes will in fact return with larger numbers. They trade with humans for wargear and vehicles, and have even worked as mercenaries for the Imperium at times (such as during the Massacre at Big Toof River). All of these things lead followers of other klanz to brand them as dangerously treacherous, cowardly, and downright un-Orky! Most Blood Axes are back-stabbing 'Kommandoz', essentially serving as Ork special operations troops. Blood Axes wear combat fatigues and forage caps in shades of green and drab colours, commonly in camouflage patterns. This betrays the influence of Imperial military style, as do the other personal adornments commonly worn by Orks of this klan. The Blood Axes bear the klan motif of crossed, bloodied axes."
 civic_oddboyz_culture:0 "Oddboyz Culture"
 civic_oddboyz_culture_desc:0 "The most important and skilled Mekboyz are known as 'Big Meks,' who lead groups of lesser Mekboyz armed with a wide variety of Greenskin kustom equipment and Kombi-weapons, sometimes including even full warbands or whole WAAAGHs! armed with a large amount of less-than-conventional Ork weaponry. A Big Mek's mastery of technology is unsurpassed amongst the Orkoid races and a Big Mek is often seen generating a 'Kustom Force Field' around himself that protects his person and his creations. A Big Mek who becomes the leader of a Greenskin WAAAGH! will be known as a 'Mek-Boss.'"
 civic_clever_nobz:0 "Clever Nobz"
 civic_clever_nobz_desc:0 "The Snakebites Clan Kultur represents their hard-bitten resilience and stubborn refusal to die. Working on everything from your Boyz to your Vehicles (after all, when Snakebites decide to muck about with technology, they build it to last), it's a little like having a Painboy to hand at all times… Being the most 'old school' of the Ork clans, the Snakebites have become highly accustomed at bringing down big prey without the aid of specialist gubbinz or technology to do it (though it can certainly help!). As a result, they have a Stratagem that is specific to their clan, the timely use of which can all but guarantee the destruction of a choice target."
 civic_combat_specialists:0 "Combat Specialists"
 civic_combat_specialists_desc:0 "The Goffs are an Ork 'klan' who represent the largest and most aggressive of the known Greenskin klanz. The Goffs are the biggest, meanest and most brutish of all their kind, and that's saying something since they are Orks. Of all the Ork klanz, the Goffs are the most inspired by the thrill and thunder of battle. Goffs will take any excuse to start a brawl, even amongst themselves. As a result the Goffs are specialists in hand-to-hand combat who prefer their battles up close and personal. They are particularly fond of the Stikkbomb, because it is hurled by hand and is excellent for close combat in trenches, ruins, bunkers and ratholes."
 civic_farsight_enclaves:0 "Farsight Enclaves"
 civic_farsight_enclaves_desc:0 "The Farsight Enclaves are a series of heavily-fortified T'au colony worlds that are independent and indeed opposed to the rule of the T'au Empire. They are led or ruled by the legendary T'au Fire Caste Commander Farsight and lie on the far side of the Damocles Gulf region of the Segmentum Ultima in the Eastern Fringe of the Milky Way Galaxy. The T'au Empire launches many probes towards what the T'au have named the Forbidden Zone, the cluster of star systems beyond the far side of the Damocles Gulf in the Eastern Fringe, although few have ever returned. The strange eddies and unreadable energies that drift in that region doubtlessly damage or reroute a portion of those lost probes, but many more are destroyed by the Farsight Enclaves' orbital defence stations that blockade all entry, save only for their own voidships."
 civic_trader_friendly:0 "Trader Friendly"
 civic_trader_friendly_desc:0 "Before being settled by the Tau, Dal'yth had a wild ecosystem of deep blue foilage and slithering segmented beasts. It was tamed long ago during the First Sphere of Expansion and has been brought into compliance with prime-level colony standards every since. Because of its high proportion of Water Caste members, Dal'yth has enjoyed beneficial trade agreements, and has recently been counted as one of the Nineteen wonders of the Tau Empire."
 civic_rustic_population:0 "Rustic Population"
 civic_rustic_population_desc:0 "D'yanoi, whose name means 'twin moons', was isolated from the main body of the Tau Empire for many years due to a fierce and unnatural space storm; this isolation led the sept to regress to a lower level of technological advancement. Although contact with D'yanoi has since been re-established, its inhabitants are still considered backwards and rustic by most Tau. The Sept has also seen many infamous Ork invasions, though its warriors have defeated each in turn, despite the horrors wrought by the greenskins. D'yanoi is cast in perpetual half-light by the complex interaction of its moons with its tide-locked orbit. D'yanoi inhabit a tidally-locked orbit, and interaction between this trait and the revolutions of its moons leaves the planet bathed in a constant twilight. When the Tau first settled the world during the First Sphere of Expansion, D'yanoi was home to colossal reptilian beasts that had to be driven back by disciplined Cadres of Fire Warriors. The D'yanoi beasts consumed many colonists before this was accomplished."
