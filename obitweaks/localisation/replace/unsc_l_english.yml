 START_SCREEN_PART_ONE_HALO_UEG_ORIGIN: "Captain's log, January 1st, 2200.\n\nOver the past century, the Unified Earth Government has solidified its authority as the central civilian government over Earth and her colonies. As far back as I can remember, the UEG was initially conceived as a supranational entity on Earth around 2075 and has since gained full autonomy over the Sol system with vested interests into expanding the human sphere to new star systems. Which means that our jobs have just became that much more interesting. As of today, the Senate has passed several legislation bills calling for the expansion of the United Nations Space Command to act as the primary overseer of military, scientific, and exploratory operations as we venture into the unknown.\n\nAs an enlisted officer of the UNSC, our mission is to uphold and advance the policies of the UEG and ensure the safety and security of the UEG territories, possessions, and areas vital to its interests.\n\nIt goes without saying that we stand ready to protect humanity and ensure its survival by any means necessary whether from insurrectionists or God-forbid extraterrestrial encounters.\n\nThe UEG has also recently announced the first line of colony ships equipped with the new Shaw-Fujikawa Translight Engines.\n\nThese new FTL drives will soon be refitted onto all UNSC vessels becoming the forefront in interstellar colonization, warfare, and space travel beyond the Sol system.\n\nIt won't be long before we receive the green light to begin expeditions into our neighboring star systems.\n\nI hope everything goes as planned...\n\n - Per Mare, Per Terras, Per Constellatum."
 
 START_SCREEN_PART_ONE_HALO_ANCESTOR_ORIGIN: "We Are Humanity!\n\nEvolved on a long forgotten verdant world, our predecessors created the first foundations for our mighty civilization, expanding our ancient interstellar empire across the stars under the philosophy of Daowa-maad.\n\nWhile our people have underwent a series of technological dark ages, suffering the wrath of warlords, and countless civil wars, we now stand as one unified empire!\n\nWe now pass on this legacy as the Ancestors, the true inheritors of the Precursors' Mantle of Responsibility as the sole protectors of this galaxy.\n\nEven now, our civilization thrives on Charum Hakkor, our mighty capital and precursor stronghold and with the assistance of our San'Shyuum allies in unlocking the secrets of precursor technology, our alliance remains united in power and concerted in our goals.\n\nIn time, our empire will create new prosperous souls across the galaxy and we will become the greatest human civilization in galactic history!"
