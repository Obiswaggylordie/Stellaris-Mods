 halo_index.1.a: "Proceed with caution."
 
 halo_index.2.name: "The Control Room"
 halo_index.2.desc: "After studying the Cartographer, we are confident that the Control Room will provide us with the answers we seek. Setting up a camp nearby, we traversed the ancient facility kept in pristine condition by the Sentinel caretakers.\n\nAt the top we were met with two large reinforced doors of Forerunner design. Our scientists accessed the terminal to unlock the doors.\n\nOnce we walked through the final doors, we entered a spacious room with a holographic projection of the Halo Ring and a central computer at its center.\n\nAccessing the control center opened up a treasure trove of information and data about the history of this Halo Ring and the Activation Index we've been looking for.\n\nBased on the initial translation, this facility was one of several within an array used for the purpose of defense and research against a biological plague that consumed much of the galaxy in their time.\n\nThe Halo Rings were meant to wipe out all biological life in the galaxy. Anyone and anything that could sustain the parasite as a food source was targeted.\n\nA weapon of last resort...\n\nThe location of a forerunner research facility is our next destination and hopefully the location of the Index."
 
 halo_index.3.name: "The Research Facility"

We found a terminal to access the lift to the facility below.\n\nEveryone is on edge as if something bad is about to happen. There are symbols on the wall that may represent certain parts of the facility or areas of scientific importance. We should be careful not to disturb or unearth anything that may be kept under lock and key.\n\nWe ventured further down to the bottom of the facility and found a large terminal connected to a portal network. Surprisingly, we were greeted by the Monitor, an AI tasked with the protection of this ring. The AI wanted to determine the purpose of our visit and to warn us of the dangers of venturing too deep. What should we do?"
 halo_index.3.a: "Let me speak to the Monitor."
 
 halo_index.30.name: "The Talk..."
 halo_index.30.desc: "Hello, I am the monitor of this installation. My installation. I have observed your colonization on this ring and I found it amusing, but now I must ask you to leave. Protocol dictated action against your colony ship when it first attempted to enter our space, but due to unforeseen circumstances, the defense systems went offline when you attempted to land. Under no circumstances should this Ring fall into the wrong hands or to those who are too primitive to understand its importance. This installation was built primarily for the purpose of eliminating the Flood. I will not allow any deviations from that purpose."
 halo_index.30.a: "Perhaps we can come to an agreement?"
 halo_index.30.b: "Don't order us around monitor!"
 halo_index.30.c: "We need the Index to stop a galactic crisis!"

 halo_index.30.b.monitor: "So be it. If you will not listen to reason, then I have no choice but to remove you by force."
 halo_index.30.c.monitor: "Crisis? What Crisis?\n\nHmmm...Analyzing your subspace communications, you speak the truth! Perhaps that may merit the use of this ring...\n\nVery well, please allow one of your scientists assist me in retrieving the Activation Index from the Library. Follow the necessary protocols and you may use the Index."
 
 halo_index.30.a.answer: "Then we have no choice. Weapons free."
 halo_index.30.b.answer: "Battlestations!"

 halo_index.4.name: "The Library"
 halo_index.4.desc: "The Monitor was true to its word. One of our scientists was suddenly transported with the monitor to the facility known as the Library. The scientist walked with the Monitor until they entered the massive elevator at its center which led straight to the Activation Index hovering above the central chamber. The scientist then successfully recovered the Index and was teleported to the control room with the rest of our expedition."
 halo_index.4.a: "Give the Monitor my regards."

 halo_index.5.name: "The Monitor Destroyed"
 halo_index.5.desc: "Our assault on the monitor was brutal, but successful. We lost a few good members to its sentinel beam, but we were able to disable it. Wave after wave of sentinels then erupted from the ring. Attacking our settlements across the ring, but our forces managed to push them back. We also analyzed the broken monitor and found the location of the Index within the Library complex. We have since sent a team to recover the Index and have returned with the key in hand."
