# The funni
All of my stellaris mods consolidated as a single github repo, cause why not lol.

## Mods
A quick summary of each mod in this repo.

### Obi's Tweaks
Obi's Tweaks is the funny main mod that tweaks and or straight up improves a majority of content in my main collection playset, adding stuff I or my frens want when we play together or in singleplayer. Currently the mod is hilariously out of date as nobody wants to play with me, so I never push updates to workshop :(
